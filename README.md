# Urban Water Detection

The orginal dataset, *Landcover.ai* contains satellite images of 9000x9000 resolution and its respective masks. The necessary features were mined from the satellite images using techniques as described in the Research Paper. Then a single image and its respective mask were cropped into 500 images, on average, with 500x500 resolution each. Using the masks given in the dataset (The 4 labels were Building; Water; Road and Background), the images containing water bodies were separated(~2500 images). Using *VGG image annotator*, these images were manually labelled into four categories, namely *Lake*; *River*; *Small River* and *Paddy Fields* and these images with their labels were used as the Dataset for the mask RCNN model.
