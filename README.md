# Urban Water Detection

The orginal dataset, *Landcover.ai* contains satellite images of 9000x9000 resolution and its respective mask. The necessary features were mined from the satellite images using techniques as described in the Research Paper. Then a single image and its respective mask was cropped into 500 images, on average, with 500x500 resolution each. Using the masks given in the dataset (The 4 labels were Building; Water; Road and Background), the images containing water bodies were separated(~2500 images). Then these images were manually labelled into four categories, namely Lake; River; Small River and Paddy Fields and used as Dataset for the mask RCNN model.
